* [Toutiao](https://www.toutiao.com/)  
    * As the most popular mobile news app in China, Toutiao has over 78 million daily active users (collected on Feb 2017), we need OLAP capability on **Trillion** level data, and only Kylin can fulfill. Take an example, the Cube for the videos analysis has more than 2.4 trillion source records, taking 4+ TB storage (source file more than 100 TB); Most of the queries can be finished in less than 1 second (same query need couple hours in Hive). From another perspective, Kylin reduces the pressure of our Hadoop cluster. This is what called "build once, use many".     
* [Qunar](https://www.qunar.com)  (_NASDAQ:QUNR_)

    * Strikingly adopted Kylin + AWS EMR solution. By adopting Kylin, the query performance was improved from 5 ~ 10 seconds to less than 1 second, and it can serve much more concurrent requests now. When workload and data increases, we just need add EMR nodes on demand then get capacity expanded. This architecture ensures we don't need worry about the data growth in next couple years.
* [Yahoo! Japan](https://about.yahoo.co.jp/info/en/) 
    * Yahoo! JAPAN uses Apache Kylin to generate tailored report for Yahoo! Shopping. Apache Kylin contributes to minimize the latency for viewing the report.
