# Install Apache Kylin on EMR #
1. Create an EMR cluster from AWS console, and remember to pick the applications configuration which contains HBase and Hive. 
![install EMR cluster](/images/blog/aws_emr_console.png "Applications configuration when creating EMR cluster")

2. Login to master node of the cluster with ssh. ([instruction](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-connect-master-node-ssh.html))

3. Download and install Kylin binary, we take Kylin version 1.5.1 as example here (please refer to [Kylin download page](http://kylin.apache.org/download/) for latest binary package). Run the commands below.

```
wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/kylin/apache-kylin-1.5.1/apache-kylin-1.5.1-HBase1.1.3-bin.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-kylin-1.5.1-HBase1.1.3-bin.tar.gz
cd apache-kylin-1.5.1-bin
export KYLIN_HOME=`pwd`
```

# Configure Apache Kylin 

To make Kylin run well on AWS EMR we need to modify some scripts. The fix can be found in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/kylin/commit/dc08186d570e16b37d9ddaab80aba28801cdb3d0) and it'll be available in Kylin's future version.

First file is `$KYLIN_HOME/bin/find-hive-dependency.sh`, starting from line 68.

```
 68 if [ -z "$HCAT_HOME" ]
 69 then
 70     echo "HCAT_HOME not found, try to find hcatalog path from hadoop home"
 71     hadoop_home=`echo $hive_exec_path | awk -F '/hive.*/lib/' '{print $1}'`
 +		is_aws=`uname -r | grep amzn`
 72     if [ -d "${hadoop_home}/hive-hcatalog" ]; then
 73       hcatalog_home=${hadoop_home}/hive-hcatalog
 74     elif [ -d "${hadoop_home}/hive/hcatalog" ]; then
 75       hcatalog_home=${hadoop_home}/hive/hcatalog
 +    	elif [ -n is_aws ] && [ -d "/usr/lib/oozie/lib" ]; then
 +      	hcatalog_home=/usr/lib/oozie/lib
 76     else
 77       echo "Couldn't locate hcatalog installation, please make sure it is installed and set HCAT_HOME..."
 78       exit 1
 79     fi
 80 else
 81     echo "HCAT_HOME is set to: $HCAT_HOME, use it to find hcatalog path:"
 82     hcatalog_home=${HCAT_HOME}
 83 fi
```

Kylin tries to detect environment such as Hive home dictionary on starting. It goes well in most time but not in AWS EMR case. In AWS EMR nodes Hcatalog libs is under `/usr/lib/oozie/lib`, which is not expected. The modification makes Kylin handle it specially once detecting it's on AWS EMR.

Second file is `$KYLIN_HOME/bin/find-hbase-dependency.sh`, starting from line 20.

```
 20 hbase_classpath=`hbase classpath`
 +
 +	is_aws=`uname -r | grep amzn`
 +	if [ -n is_aws ] && [ -d "/usr/lib/oozie/lib" ]; then
 +    	export HBASE_ENV_INIT="true"
 +	fi
 +
 21 arr=(`echo $hbase_classpath | cut -d ":"  --output-delimiter=" " -f 1-`)
```

In AWS EMR Hbase scripts reset environment variable `HBASE_CLASSPATH` in its first run, which is determined by environment variable `HBASE_ENV_INIT`. Kylin builds its own class path according to this variable. To avoid missing libs caused by `HBASE_CLASSPATH` reseting, Kylin set `HBASE_ENV_INIT` to `"true"` so that `HBASE_CLASSPATH` won't be reset next time run `hbase classpath`.

# Load sample data and start Apache Kylin

Run following commands to load sample data and start Kylin service.

```
$KYLIN_HOME/bin/sample.sh
$KYLIN_HOME/bin/kylin.sh start
```

Now you can play with Kylin. For further guide, please refer to [Kylin official doc](http://kylin.apache.org/docs15/).
