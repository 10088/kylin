__Upgrade__
 
__This version is not backward compatible__. The format of cube and metadata has been refactored in order to get times of performance improvement. We recommend this version, but does not suggest upgrade from previous deployment directly. A clean and new deployment of this version is strongly recommended. If you have to upgrade from previous deployment, an upgrade guide will be provided by community later.
