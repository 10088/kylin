## Install

The v2.0.0 beta requires a refresh install at the moment. It cannot be upgraded from v1.6.0 due to the incompatible metadata. However the underlying cube is backward compatible. We are working on an upgrade tool to transform the metadata, so that a smooth upgrade will be possible.

## Run TPC-H Benchmark

Steps to run TPC-H benchmark on Apache Kylin can be found here: [https://github.com/Kyligence/kylin-tpch](https://github.com/Kyligence/kylin-tpch)

## Spark Cubing Engine

Apache Kylin v2.0.0 introduced a new cubing engine based on Apache Spark that can be selected to replace the original MR engine. Initial tests showed that the spark engine could cut the build time to 50% in most cases.

To enable the Spark cubing engine:

- Read [this blog](/blog/2017/02/23/by-layer-spark-cubing/) at first, then go through the "Spark Engine Configs" settings in `kylin.properties` carefully.
  - Make sure the `kylin.env.hadoop-conf-dir` contains site xmls of core, yarn, hive, and hbase.
  - Adjust the numbers of spark executor instances, cores, and memory according to your environment.
  - Hive on Tez somehow did not work out as we tested. Switching to Hive on MR worked.
- When creating a new cube, select the spark engine in the advanced settings tab. And that is it!
