The Apache Kylin community is pleased to announce the release of Apache Kylin v1.6.0.

Apache Kylin is an open source Distributed Analytics Engine designed to provide SQL interface and multi-dimensional analysis (OLAP) on Hadoop supporting extremely large datasets.

This is a major release after 1.5.4, with the reliable and scalable support for using Apache Kafka as data source; this enables user to build cubes directly from streaming data (without loading to Apache Hive), reducing the data latency from days/hours to minutes. 

Apache Kylin 1.6.0 resolved 102 issues including bug fixes, improvements, and new features. All of the changes can be found in the [release notes]( 
https://kylin.apache.org/docs16/release_notes.html).
